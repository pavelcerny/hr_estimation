INSTALLATION
============

We now support only project configuration with CMake (www.cmake.org)

Linux:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create dir where you want the binaries to be build (we refer to path to this dir as $BIN and to the path to directory
with source codes as $SRC). Source codes are in ./cpp/ directory. Change working directory to $BIN and run
CMake as follows:

	ccmake $SRC

Now configure project with CMake. Turn on the BUILD_MATLAB_BINDINGS if you want the mex-files to be produced
(for this it is important to have path to MEX and MEX_EXT specified correctly).

After the configuration with MATLAB compile the source codes with

	make

This will produce 3 executable examples in the $BIN/cpp directory:

	flandmark_simple_example	-	simplest example using flandmark. Given an image and bbox as command line arguments
					it calls flandmark to detect facial landmarks.
					Usage (in $BIN/cpp directory): ./flandmark_simple_example face.jpg 72 72 183 183

	flandmark_1		- 	this example requires image as parameter. Then it performs OpenCV face detection and
					the facial landmark detection. Only the biggest face in image is detected. Optionaly
					user can specify also second argument - the name of output image, if this argument is
					specified, image with detected landmarks is produced.
					Usage (in $BIN/cpp directory): ./flandmark_1 groupphoto.jpg

	flandmark_2		-	this example requires webcamera or video sequence. It starts capturing frames from camera and performs
					OpenCV face detection together with the flandmark detector. It is also possible to save the
					generated output both for webcamera and video sequence input.
					Usage (in #BIN/cpp directory): ./flandmark_2 seq_bruges04_300frames.avi		// to use with video input
									./flandmark_2 0 output.avi	// to use with webcam input and writing output to output.avi

If CMake is configured with BUILD_MATLAB_BINDINGS=ON it also produces following mex-files:

	flandmark_load_model	- 	produces binary .dat file with flandmark model data structure
	flandmark_detector	- 	performs facial landmark detection given an image and detected face bbox
	flandmark_detector_base	- 	performs the facial landmark detection given normalized image frame
	getNormalizedFrame	- 	given an image and detected face bbox will create the normalized image frame
	lbp2sparse		- 	computes sparse LBP features
	argmax_mex		-	fast computation of dynamic programming of flandmark task


Windows:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run cmake-gui, specify the source codes and binary directories. Configure project. In the binary directory
you can find generated project files. Compile the project with IDE chosen during CMake project configuration.


MATLAB
======

For learning the parameters of detector just run the following script:

	./learning/flandmark_learn.m	- 	This is the main script that calls all necessary scripts to produce
						flandmark_model.dat (the binary file containing the generated flandmark model, which
						is used by the flandmark library)

NOTE: for running this script it, the symbolic link ./learning/flandmark_data/LFW pointing to the directory
containing the LFW images has to be present. Otherwise the scirpt will end with error message.

You can try flandmark by running the simple example

	flandmark_simple_example.m	-	simple script, that takes random image from ./data/Images (small subset
			of LFW images along with face detections stored in separate files)
